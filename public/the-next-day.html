                                    <p>I was never more anxious and elated to start to work ever before. Was it an exciting new project or the first day after promotion or the day I was going to be recognized for my contribution to the team? No, none! It was the day after Mr. He expressed his strong feelings of liking for me. Waking up to a fantasy come to reality felt super nice. I quickly took shower, got into a decent — not too fancy dress, left my hair open, put on mild lip color, wore my perfume and was all set to go. My brother and I commute together to work as his workplace was close to mine. He already noticed that I was looking different that day. On our way he told me I was looking ugly. We share a typical sibling relationship and he is the naughty one. I didn’t bother and threw a smile at him as that was his way of expressing I was looking good. He is a sweet soul and I love him to infinity. I dropped him off and wished him a beautiful day.
                                    <p>
                                    I reached work and I am not sure if Mr. He has reached yet. I took the elevator and my heart beat caught pace with each floor. I rushed to my desk, dropped my belongings and started walking towards his bay, which is around fifty steps away. I keep my head down as I walk. I don’t have a nerve to keep my eyelids up. What if I catch him looking back at me? I’ll melt down feeling shy in front of my entire team. What if someone observes? I’ll put myself to embarrassment. I see through the corner of my eye. He is not at his desk. As every other day, I go to my friend that is his lead and sits in the same bay. I wish her good morning. The moment she looks at me, she compliments I was looking fresh and asks the reason for me blushing. I give her a mischievous smile and escape, telling her I need to grab a coffee.<p>
                                    <p>
                                    On my way by his desk, I saw two people standing at another friend’s desk that is few steps away through the corner of my eye. One of them facing me and looking at me. I halt at his desk, turn towards them, put my arms on the brim of his cubicle and look up. It’s him, looking at me right into my eyes. Oh THE look! Everything shut down for a moment. It felt as if it were just the two of us on the floor. I felt my heart spreading tremors of ecstasy all over my body. My hands started shaking. But I kept staring at him without blinking for few straight seconds. So did he. We greeted each other with a hushed smile. I walked speedily to my desk putting behind my coffee.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    I tried to settle down at my desk hoping no one to have observed me. I was still trembling. But I tried to dig into work. Within no time I saw a ping from him on messenger. I told him I was shaking from the moment I stepped into the office. He calls me and asks if I want to talk, in person, for fifteen minutes as it was lunch time already. Our friends might look for us and he didn’t want us to vanish for long. I said yes hesitantly as I was feeling awfully exposed mixed with a feeling of immense bliss. Though I didn’t reveal that the feeling of strong liking is mutual, it was apparent from my expressions and tone. He asked me to meet him in one of the balconies where the probability of employees taking a break is low. I jumped out of my chair right away and reached the area. I see him there waiting.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    We met at the same place many times earlier during coffee breaks. But this time it was way more special. We couldn’t look at each other into the eyes. We both faced the posh residential area next to our building. We were silent for a while. He says, ‘So, tell me!’ And I started telling him the ride I had since the moment I woke up. We kept talking for more than fifteen minutes. Few colleagues came to the same balcony for a break. They saw us together many times before. But we never felt uncomfortable talking in front of them or anyone. This time it was different. We felt uneasy. Probably because our conversation was utterly private and we didn’t want to generate even an iota of unnecessary rumor at work place. Neither were we ready to disclose our feelings to anyone. We decided to meet in the recreation area on the ground floor after work. We didn’t want to leave. But we had to.<br>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Those few hours of wait seemed ten folds longer. We met after work as planned. Not just us, I felt the nature also planned that evening for us. The refreshing evening breeze, the scenic sunset view from our recreation area, the beautiful landscape adjacent to our building, had already set the mood for a pleasant talk. He went first. He said, ‘I like you very very very very very much! I want to love you!’ Was I delusional or was it happening for real?! I couldn’t stop blushing. The talkative me couldn’t help but stayed tongue-tied and listened to the most awaited expressions.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    I let myself soak in that lovely moment. Then, I started telling him how I felt and I finally let it out how much that feeling of liking was mutual. I added, I always felt from within he was a notch above any other person I ever met as he was the most genuine of all people that approached me. It was slowly turning to be one of the most memorable conversations of my life. And then I heard my phone ring. It was my brother asking if I was done for the day. His call made me realize it was already more than a couple hours into our conversation and way past the time I leave work everyday. I hesitantly had to tell my brother, I’ll be leaving in a bit and was going to pick him up in half hour. I didn’t want to keep him waiting longer.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Mr. He and I didn’t feel like leaving. I am sure not just us, anyone experiencing that moment would want to stay in it forever. We had to get back to office to collect our belongings. As we got out of the elevator on our floor, we noticed some colleagues still working. This time not just me, he as well didn’t want anyone to notice both of us blushing. It was hard to hide our feelings in a poker face as we dispersed to our desks. I collected my things and turned towards his desk. He was standing there and we smiled at each other wishing bye for the day.</p>
                                    <p>That day ended with a night long WhatsApp chat and dozing off into dreamland. The next day, and the next day, and many next days followed unfolding life’s most magical, challenging and key moments for both of us.<br>
                                    </p>
