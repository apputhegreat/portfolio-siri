                                    <p>Did you ever say ‘No’ to any favor you are asked? Did you ever do something against your will, just to please someone or to fit in? Do you try to be someone who everyone around wants you to be? Do you tell yourself that you are happy because you have made others happy? Are you too patient with everything and everyone around you that you raise your threshold bar every time your previous threshold exceeds? At work, well yes, you must have! Positively! With family and friends or the so called loved ones? I am nearly sure you must have. Are you a people pleaser? How often do you try to please people? Do you even know you are one?</p>
                                    <p>
                                    I don’t consider people pleasing badly or as something that should be dodged on in life. It feels good when you (push your limits to) make loved ones happy, bring smile to people around you (at the cost of yours), or prioritize someone else’s feelings and needs (over yours). Yes, I am talking about the extreme behavior. To what extent do you think one can go to please someone?</p>
                                    <p>
                                    Well in my book, here is the flip-side of being a people pleaser. Initially you start doing things to make others happy or to stay in others' good books or to fit in and make friends. In doing so repeatedly, you portray a different self to people around you. At some point you tune yourself to doing things at odds with how you truly wish. Eventually people take you for granted. You end up hurt and possibly get into an irreversible equation with so called friends and loved ones. And this feeling of living a lie sets in and you start feeling miserable. All this despite of your deeds being well intended.</p>
                                    <p>
                                    Once people get used to a certain behavior of yours, isn’t it unfair to expect them to accept or pursue your other (true) self? Now whose fault is that? It might all sound very complicated or you might think I am exaggerating. But trust me! I have been there, I have done that all my life. And at a point I blamed myself for being so and letting people hurt me (after all ‘they’ are my loved ones and I can’t blame them). The sad part is, ‘they’ dint know they were doing so, as they got used to my accommodating, sweet and so called pleasing nature.</p>
                                    <p>
                                    Here is how I worked on my-self to overcome this trait in me as I clearly understood this is not who I was, I became someone who got lost in a false self and was paying a price of my true self. And this is an effort to give my two cents to everyone who excessively people please:</p>
                                    <p>
                                    <b>Know yourself better:</b> Focus your energy inwards to understand who you really are, what are your needs and wants. You are not what you repeatedly do without knowing why you are doing it or doing it because everyone else around you is doing so or doing it just because every time you do it you make someone happy.</p>
                                    <p>
                                    <b>Set a limit:</b> It is said – There is a limit to everything and beyond limit everything is poison. This can be applied to everything in life. You don’t have to be a people pleaser all the time. Try to analyze the situations and people around you. Try to draw line and firmly tell people what you truly are, when things cross the limit you set.</p>
                                    <p>
                                    <b>Learn to say ‘No’:</b> Saying ‘No’ is not being harsh or hurting someone. It does not introduce negativity into any conversation. Neither does it make you a bad person. You are indeed being honest with your opinion. And honesty is one of the foundation pillars of any relationship.</p>
                                    <p>
                                    <b>‘First time’ is always difficult:</b> Any change you try to bring in yourself is difficult implementing for the first time. Don’t panic and fall off the track again. Remember you are resolute to it after a deep hurt and long analysis. Give it some time; everything will fall in place. You are not forcing yourself into it. You now have understood who you are and you are just trying to bring it inside out. Trust me, you’ll feel better after all this.</p>
                                    <p>
                                    This might not be a life threatening problem like cancer or nuclear bomb. But, it is important to make everyone around understand you as ‘YOU’, for better relationships and better living. In a nutshell – It’s okay to please someone, it’s okay to make someone happy. But you should know your limit, and tune yourself to that limit or probably to a 5–10% buffer sometimes (according to the situation or person in your equation), definitely not to a degree that people start contemplating you as that person you depict but you are not. I believe in one thing (one of the many things ;)) – Respect your feelings, your time and yourself. And be loyal to yourself. Only when you respect yourself others will respect you.
                                  </p>
